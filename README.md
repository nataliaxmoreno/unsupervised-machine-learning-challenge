# unsupervised-machine-learning-challenge
In this assignment, I applied  unsupervised learning knowledge by fitting data to a model and using clustering algorithms to place data into groups. Then, I created a couple visualization that shares the findings.

Part 1: Prepare the Data

Part 2: Apply Dimensionality Reduction
utilizing the concepts of data pipeline I performed data reducion with Standarscaler PCA and T-SNE algorithms

Part 3: Perform a Cluster Analysis with K-means
